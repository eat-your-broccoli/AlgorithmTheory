/**
 * Assignment
 *
 *  1. Write a Java method that can compute the n-th power (n E N) of a given square matrix
 * M with BigInteger items efficiently.
 *
 *  2. Write an ecient Java program that reads a natural number n from the input and then
 * computes the number a(n) of binary words of length n with at least two 0-digits between
 * two 1-digits.
 *
 *  3. Write an ecient Java program that reads a natural number n and a positive natural
 * number k from the input and then computes the number a(n) of binary words of length
 * n with at least k 0-digits between two 1-digits.
 *
 *  4. Write a Java program that reads a natural number n from the input and computes the
 * number of partitions of n into pieces of size 2, 3, 4.
 *
 *  5. Write a Java program that reads a natural number n and two positive natural numbers k
 * and m from the input and computes the number of partitions of n into pieces of size k
 * and m.
